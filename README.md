# fillwith

A LaTeX package for filling vertical space with something rather than nothing.

Currently supported somethings are solid rules and dotted lines, with or 
without numbers. The package uses a mixture of plain-ish macros, LaTeX 2e and 
expl3 methods, but a key-value approach to configuration should make the 
document-level interface relatively sane, even if nothing else is.

For details, please see fillwith.pdf. The implementation is minimally 
documented because I have no idea of how to document code.
